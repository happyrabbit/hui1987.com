# Business & Economics 
## The Wealth of Nations [Adam Smith]
### Of the Causes of Improvement in the productive Powers of Labour, and of the Order according to which its Produce is naturally distributed among the different Ranks of the People
#### Of the Division of Labour

The author discussed the cause and effects of division of labour.

- The division of labour arises from a propensity in human nature to exchange [分工不是人类智慧的结晶，是因为我们需要互相帮忙，人类这种需要交换的趋势促成了分工的产生。]
- The division of labour (not natural differences) gives rise to differences of talent. [分工导致了人们在不同事业不同领域表现各种才能，而不是天赋的差异导致分工]

#### Of the Principle which gives Occasion to the Division of Labour [论分工如何受到市场范围的限制]

- 分工的程度会被当时的交换能力限制住，而分工又起因于交换能力，当然这个范围限制决定了分工的范围。市场小：不鼓励专一职业。因为人们没有能力把自己消费不了的劳动产品中的剩余部分哪去交换别人的剩余物品。

## Principles of Economics [Alfred Marshall]
### Introduction

- **Political Economy** or **Economics** is a study of mankind in the ordinary business of life......it is on the one side a study of wealth; and on the other and more important side, a part of the study of man.......two great forming agencies of the world's history have been _religious_ and _economic_.

### The substance of economics
- **Economics** is a study of men as they live and move and think in the ordinary business of life. But it concerns itself chiefly with those motives which affect, most powerfully and most steadily man's conduct in the business part of his life......the steadiest motive to ordinary business work is the desire for the pay which is the material reward of work.
